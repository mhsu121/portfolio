      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>craigslist (lower case "c” intentional) has always been an interesting case study amongst designers—how can something that defies most modern design principles and that hasn’t been updated visually since the 1990s work so well from a design perspective? There are a few theories:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s simple and easy-to-use; users don’t have to relearn how to use it whenever an update comes out</li>
          <li>The information architecture is superb—everything is well organized, even if it doesn’t look great</li>
          <li>The lack of flashy design actually helps users accomplish what they need to do more quickly</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I decided to set out on the task of seeing if a rebrand of craigslist while keeping the above core principles intact was at all possible.</p>

      <h2>MIND MAP</h2>
      <p>To get some creative juices flowing, I laid out a quick mind map of terms I associated with craigslist.</p>
      <img src="images/craigslist-mindmap.jpg" alt="craigslist-mindmap" />
      <p>The words and phrases that stood out the most to me from the mind-mapping exercise were: communication platform, local / location based, people-to-people, sharing, simple, and community.</p>
      <p>craigslist is a platform to connect people as they travel around the world—when moving to new places or traveling in different areas, it's used as a way to find out about local events, find new housing or job opportunities, and even buy used furniture to get set up in a new home. In that sense, it’s very community based and is a platform for people looking to help each other.</p>
      <p>craigslist is a place to find used items that have history—items are passed on from person to person. Even though something is no longer of use to the original owner, it can represent something significant for the next person. craigslist is a platform for almost everything under the sun--there are job postings, personal ads, housing ads, items for sale. It's an all-encompassing circle.</p>

      <h2>LOGO DESIGN</h2>
      <p>Using the above concepts as inspiration, I sketched out a few thumbnails for potential logos. I wanted to keep the simplicity of the current design—it speaks a lot to how the platform is strictly user to user and keeps out corporate influences. I played around with adding color and experimented with different font styles.</p>

  <section class="styleguide" id="styleguide">
    <div class="container">
      <h2>STYLE GUIDE</h2>
      <p>The final step in my craigslist rebranding exploration was to create a style guide for the website, including logo, color palette, typography, and buttons / forms. The best part of craigslist is its simplicity—users are able to navigate the site quickly and find what they are looking for. In my design, I wanted to retain that element of simplicity while adding stylistic accents that would flow cohesively throughout the design.</p>
      <p>The logo design I ended up selecting was one of the most basic from my sketches. It uses a sans serif font and uses moving arrows to form the letter "C", an ode to the original design’s simplicity while representing the way craigslist fosters and connects communities. I kept the color palette simple—the only color that appears outside of the blue in the logo are links and clickable buttons (and in special cases, headers). craigslist's most important feature is unarguably, its links. The coloring of links is kept in a traditional, unformatted style (blue for link, underlined purple for visited) to keep them easily recognizable. I also added a bold effect to appear when hovering over links, to allow them to stand out even more and to minimize unintended clicks.</p>
      <p>This simple design allows users to focus on content rather than spend time figuring out navigation and being distracted by complex design elements, furthering craigslist's mission to "connect the world for the common good."</p>
